## Process

### Initial Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your forked repository onto your local machine
3. Inside your CLI (Command Line Interface), move into your working directory
4. RUN `npm run dev-setup` to install project-wide development dependencies. Afterwards this command will start up the docker development containers for the client, api and database. This step may take serveral minutes.

### How to Contribute

1. Create a branch for your feature (see [below](#feature-branch-example) for an example)
2. Add your code
3. Create a Pull Request

## Commit Messages & Pull Requests

For consistency and easier readability, we would like to ask everyone to use the templates for Pull Requests and Issues that we provide.
They follow this pattern:

```
<subject> (A title to summarise what this is about)

<body> (A detailed description of your PR, feature idea or issue)

Resolves #ISSUE_NUMBER
```

Note: It is important to add the #number for the issue the PR is resolving in order to close the issue accordingly once the PR gets merged. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
